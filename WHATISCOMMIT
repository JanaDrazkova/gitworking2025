Commits can be thought of as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of a Git project. Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time. Git Snapshots are always committed to the local repository. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to.
