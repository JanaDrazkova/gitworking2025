Branch is:

a) Brown-green leafy pointy thing, highly dangerous - potentially deadly.

b) Mean of torture for poor aspiring Git students.

c) Inovative mean of collaboration - basically a copy of whatever is the state of work at the moment with all its history, used so I can do dangerous work without any danger to the original teamwork.  

d) All of the above
